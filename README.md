# SoliFood

Welcome to the SoliFood Github repository! SoliFood is a platform that connects food donors with food banks and other organizations that help feed the hungry. This repository contains the source code for the SoliFood platform, including the backend, frontend, and AI models that power the platform.

## Structure

This repository is structured as follows:

- `backend/`: This directory contains the backend code of the SoliFood platform, including the API endpoints, database models, and business logic implemented in TypeScript using Firebase functions.
- `frontend/`: Here, you will find the frontend code for the SoliFood platform, implemented using JavaScript, Angular, and TailwindCSS. This directory also includes the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the user interface.
- `search-service/`: This directory contains the code for the semantic search service that powers the SoliFood platform. The search service is implemented using Python (Flask) and Gemini embeedings.
- `seed/`: This directory contains the seed data for the SoliFood platform, including the initial data that is loaded into the database when the platform is first deployed.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide a collaborative space for development and improvement of the SoliFood platform. By making the repository publicly accessible, we aim to foster community engagement, allowing developers, contributors, and users to explore the codebase, report issues, and suggest enhancements.

## How Generative AI Models Power SoliFood

SoliFood uses generative AI models to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the food donation process. The current use case of AI in SoliFood is to optimize the search process for food donors and food banks. By using generative AI models, SoliFood can provide more relevant search results, reduce the time it takes to find matching food donors and food banks, and increase the overall efficiency of the food donation process.
